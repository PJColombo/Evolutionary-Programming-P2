# Evolutionary-Programming-P2

An evolutive algorithm implementation to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). 

We need to find the cheapest path that visits 28 spanish cities exactly once and returns to the starting city.


This project also offers a genetic algorithm solution to different functions where we need to find a series of values which optimizes the function.
